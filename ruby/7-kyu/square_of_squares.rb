A square of squares
You like building blocks.
You especially like building blocks that are squares. A
nd what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square.
Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle!
Those blasted things!
If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it!
You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
is_square (-1) # => false
is_square   3 # => false
is_square   4 # => true
is_square  25 # => true
is_square  26 # => false
